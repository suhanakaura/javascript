<!-- console is a debugger, developer tool
many engines are used to run js - v8 engine
v8 - whole engine is written in js
it provides debugging tools and some api's access 
core javascript doesn't contain console and api

in v8/v8 repo - console.cc repo is actually the console , it's in c++ 
whole js is a wrapper over c++ -->

<!-- whole engine goes to browser , browser doesn't directly prints it , engine provides it a dev tool i.e inside console ..that's where it has to be printed. that's where those files are actually written -->
